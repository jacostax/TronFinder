# TRON (TRX) Wallet Address and Private Key Generator

With this Python script, you can find wallet addresses of randomly generated private keys.

When the program finds the private key value of the wallet address you want among randomly generated addresses, it writes the wallet and private key values to a separate text file. If the checked addresses are different from the wallet address you want, the file created after the check is deleted.

With a little editing, you can find wallet addresses whose balance value is greater than zero.
